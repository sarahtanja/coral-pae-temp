## **Montipora capitata** survive by symbiosis

::: {.notes}
Corals are invertebrates closely related to sea anemones in the phylum Cnidaria. Individual animals are known as polyps, which are each crowned by an oral disc or mouth fringed by tentacles that house stinging nematocysts,

The corals I'm going to speak about today are stony (or scleractinian) corals that build a hard calcium carbonate (aragonite, a crystalline form of calcium carbonate) skeleton under their soft tissue.

The polyp's soft tissue body sits in the corallite stony cup it builds, and can be retracted (they are nocturnal, with polyps and tentacles eerging at night, and mainly staying retracted during the day).

Reef-building corals are fascinating wonderful animals that survive in oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) warm tropical waters through their symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae called symbiodinium.

## **Montipora capitata** belong to the dominant group of reef-building corals

![](images/coral01a_462.jpg)

::: {.notes}

Although some corals are solitary polyps most are colonial, in which a founding single polyp reproduces asexually by budding into large, often beautiful structured coral colonies, and when many colonies (of different species) are all growing and living together they form what we know as a 'reef'.

The importance of the reef is well illustrated in movies like 'Finding Nemo', the reef is home to a diversity of marine organisms. When scientists talk about the ecosystem functions of reefs we're talking about all the good things reefs do: they provide 3D structural habitat, the mucus secreting from them Reefs are essential habitat and

Montipora capitata are members of the Acroporidae family of stony corals which are characterized by their small polyps and the presence of a corallite (skeletal cup) at the tip of each branch

And I want you to keep in mind that all those functions, all those good things, depends on the survival of

## Slide Backgrounds {background="#43464B"}

Reef corals require clear water so that sunlight can reach their zooxanthellae for photosynthesis. For this reason they are generally found only in waters with small amounts of suspended material, or water of low turbidity and low productivity. This leads to an interesting paradox---coral reefs require clear, nutrient-poor water, but `they are among the most productive and diverse marine environments`.
