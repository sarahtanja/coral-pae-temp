::: notes
Corals are invertebrates closely related to sea anemones in the phylum Cnidaria. Individual animals are known as polyps, which are each crowned by an oral disc or mouth fringed by tentacles that house stinging nematocysts,

The corals I'm going to speak about today are stony (or scleractinian) corals that build a hard calcium carbonate (aragonite, a crystalline form of calcium carbonate) skeleton under their soft tissue.

Montipora capitata are members of the Acroporidae family of stony corals which are characterized by their small polyps and the presence of a corallite (skeletal cup) at the tip of each branch

::: notes
The polyp's soft tissue body sits in the corallite stony cup it builds, and can be retracted (they are nocturnal, with polyps and tentacles emerging at night, and mainly staying retracted during the day).

## **Montipora capitata** survive by symbiosis

> "Symbiosis is the living together of unlike organisms" - Anton Heinrich de Bary, 1878


::: notes
Reef-building corals are fascinating wonderful animals that survive in oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) warm tropical waters through their symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae called symbiodinium.

## Holobionts are an assembly of host and symbionts

::: notes
The holobiont concept posits that a host and its associated microbiota with which it interacts, form a holobiont, and have to be studied together as a coherent biological and functional unit to understand its biology, ecology, and evolution.

## `Coral reefs` require clear, nutrient-poor water, but they `are among the most productive marine environments, and support 25% of marine biodiversity`  {background="#43464B"}

 When scientists talk about the ecosystem functions of reefs we're talking about all the good things reefs do: they provide 3D structural habitat, the mucus secreting from them Reefs are essential habitat and
 
The importance of the reef is well illustrated in movies like 'Finding Nemo', the reef is home to a diversity of marine organisms. 

And I want you to keep in mind that all those functions, all those good things, depends on the survival of corals, facilitated by symbionts

::: notes
Declines in coral cover were first noticed by \[person\] in \[location\], and has rapidly gotten worse. Corals cover reduction often due to coral mass bleaching, and coral disease is a conservation problem that scientists have been alarmed about since \[year\]

`8 million tons` of plastics enter the oceans `every year` Like this art piece by photographer Celine Bellanger on the coast of France depits, this is the monster we are fighting

## How do the combined stressors of `heat` and `phthalates` affect the `coral microbiome`? {background="#43464B"}

. . . 

<br/>

## To address this question, I ran an acute toxicity study and exposed fragments from 10 *Montipora capitata* colonies to mesocosms of either control, heat, phthalates, or heat+phthalates

## After 48 hours we flash froze the fragments, and extracted DNA for 16S sequencing

## Because of their symbiotic relationships `coral reefs` survive in clear, nutrient-poor water, and `are among the most productive marine environments, supporting 25% of marine biodiversity` {background="#43464B"}
