## Overview

Here I follow the QIIME2 [Casava 1.8 paired-end demultiplexed fastq](https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.5/tutorials/importing/#:~:text=Casava%201.8%20single%2Dend%20demultiplexed%20fastq) tutorial on importing data. The 16S sequences were provided to me from Mr. DNA via a DropBox download link. They are **Demultiplexed** (aka **Demuxed**) sequences that still have the forward and reverse primers in the sequences.
