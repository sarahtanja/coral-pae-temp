# coral-pae-temp

This repo contains files for the multiple-stressor experiment I conducted in August 2022 at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) in Kaneohe Bay. In this experiment, I exposed coral fragments to a chemical mix of 6 common phthalate pollutants in methanol and thermal stress for 48 hours. Unfortunately, in this pilot experiment, we lack a methanol solvent control. This means that we cannot differentiate the effects of the phthalate pollutants from the effects of the methanol on the microbial community changes when compared to the no-pollution controls.

I then snap-froze the coral fragments in liquid nitrogen, and analyzed them for differences in microbiome community structure and differential gene expression (DGE) among treatment groups.  

coral = *Montipora capitata*, commonly known as 'rice coral', a key reef-building coral in Hawaii

pae = Phthalate Acid Esters, a category of chemicals commonly added to plastic polymers like poly-vinyl chloride (PVC) to make them flexible

temp = acute thermal stress simulating summer heat-wave conditions in Hawaii
