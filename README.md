# coral-pae-temp
coral = *Montipora capitata*, commonly known as 'rice coral', a key reef-building coral in Hawaii
pae = Phthalate Acid Esters, a category of chemicals commonly added to plastics to make them flexible
temp = acute thermal stress simulating summer heat-wave conditions in Hawaii

This repo contains files for the multiple-stressor mesocosm experiment I conducted in August 2022 at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) in Kaneohe Bay. In this experiment, I exposed coral fragments to phthalate pollution and thermal stress for 72 hours. I then snap-froze the coral fragments in liquid nitrogen, and analyzed them for differences in microbiome community structure and differential gene expression (DGE) among treatment groups.  

this repo is organized as follows:
